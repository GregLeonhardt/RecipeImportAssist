    The PG Offline conversion program is mostly written BBUUTTT...


    I just realized there is a major design flaw in the implementation.  I am modifing
    input data and sometimes the output is larger tham the input but I am inserting
    it into the input buffer causing an overflow (maybe trunking data).


    Anyhow I need to swap buffers where a new (output) buffer is allocated inside
    the function that is modifying data, then return the new output buffer and releasing
    what was the input buffer.  At least something like that.'}

    about finished PG Offline conversion program.  The decode is done but I have to
    write the results to an output file.  I need to write a 'file_write( ) function

    watching the converted stuff run down the screen I think I figured a way to get
    MXP NOTES: and stuff.  Right now I am looking for the '- - - - -' and saying that
    is the end of the recipe but it isn't.\n\nPer Serving, Nutr. Assoc., and NOTES
    that follow.  I plan on dumping the Per Serving, Nutr. Assoc. stuff but I don't
    want to loose the NOTES.\n\nAnyhow, if I include everything to the start of the
    next recipe or end of e-Mail it will at least be passed to the MXP decoder.\n\n=

    === #016 Directions Decode ===


    The new code for formatting the recipe directions is almost working.  The basics
    are there but I need to add some code to allow for appending to the previous line
    of text.'}

    I have deviated from working on the code to implementing a revision control system.  Not
    because it is the best or even the easiest to use, I went with Mercurial.  A startup
    version of the server is up and running on a VirtualBox Linux system.  The next
    step is going to be moving it to a physical system.  I can put it on ''NAS'' but
    I would rather put it on the RasPi.  Much smaller footprint and it is already
    running 24/7/365.  However, I don''t want to interfear with other stuff already
    running there.  We''ll see..


    === #017 Numberd Directions ===


    Some recipes have numbered directions where each line of the directions is prefixed
    with a number.  The numbers need to be deleted before puting the information on
    the directions list.'}

    New that I have Mercurial fully operational I will no longer be doing nightly
    ''zip'' file creation.  The master repository is on the ''STORA'' NAS disk in
    "/MyLibrary/Mercurial" which is mounteded to local directory /mnt/Mercurial.  This
    has the added benifet of being backed up weekly to the cloud.


    To make the mount happen first install:


    sudo apt install -y cifs-utils


    Then add the following to /etc/fstab


    # Mount the Mercurial drive

    //stora/MyLibrary/Mercurial /mnt/Mercurial cifs sec=ntlmv2,username=g06xdw4,password=1YW9bjnf,uid=greg,gid=greg,file_mode=07770,rw
    0 0



    The above is all one line.
